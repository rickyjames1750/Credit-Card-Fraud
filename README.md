# Credit-Card-Fraud

## Mission
The problem presented is analyzing historical data of credit card transactions that were fraudulent and cards that werenâ€™t fraudulent. The goal of this model is to predict future transactions as fraud. The model will be targeted to be optimized for precision rather than recall. Since it is important that this model identifies most of the fraud transactions with as much accuracy as possible.

## The Dataset
The datasets contains transactions made by credit cards in September 2013 by european 
cardholders. This dataset presents transactions that occurred in two days, where we 
have 492 frauds out of 284,807 transactions. The dataset is highly unbalanced, the 
positive class (frauds) account for 0.172% of all transactions. 
It contains only numerical input variables which are the result of a PCA transformation. 
Unfortunately, due to confidentiality issues, we cannot provide the original features and 
more background information about the data. Features V1, V2, ... V28 are the principal 
components obtained with PCA, the only features which have not been transformed with 
PCA are 'Time' and 'Amount'. Feature 'Time' contains the seconds elapsed between each 
transaction and the first transaction in the dataset. The feature 'Amount' is the 
transaction Amount, this feature can be used for example-dependant cost-senstive 
learning. Feature 'Class' is the response variable and it takes value 1 in case of fraud and 
0 otherwise.
